# Serba

Lightweight HTTP File server written in Micronaut and compiled using GraalVM.

Features:
- Add multiple libraries and users
- Control which libraries can each user see
- See current and past downloads, their progress and average speed
- Zipped folder downloads (note: the zipping process is currently happening in background and the file will download after it's zipped, the request to the link might seem to be hanging while that's happening, just wait)

### minimal docker compose

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/d4rckh/serba:latest
    container_name: serba-backend
    volumes:
      - /my_data_folder:/data
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      JDBC_URL: jdbc:postgresql://serba-postgres:5432/serba
      DB_USERNAME: serba
      DB_PASSWORD: serba
    depends_on:
      - serba-postgres

  serba-postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: serba-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: serba
      POSTGRES_USER: serba
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: serba
    restart: unless-stopped
```

After accessing the login page, an admin user will be created and it's password will be printed in the container logs, as soon as you login go to /admin and change your admin user's password. There, you will also be able to create a library.
